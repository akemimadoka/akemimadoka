My blog:
- [兔之屋](https://syaro.hotococoa.moe/wordpress/): A useless blog, nothing interesting here, but someday I'll fill it with my study achievement, maybe?

My proud projects:
- [Cafe](https://github.com/akemimadoka/Cafe): A C++ generic utility library, for self-use mainly.
- [LLVMCMakeBackend](https://github.com/akemimadoka/LLVMCMakeBackend): A cmake backend for llvm, incubating... If you think it's totally useless, you are right!😝
- And more incubating projects! Not mature enough to show publicly now... Or maybe it will never be? I don't want it to be true...
